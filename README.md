* Developed a prediction program.
* Programmed using Python, Sklearn Library, Keras/TensorFlow library.
* Program can predict whether a user will click an Ad on a website or not.
* Built a logistic regression model from scratch, a logistic regression model using Sklearn Library, and Neural
Network model using Keras Library.
* Accuracy was 84% when built logistic regression model from scratch, 94% when built logistic regression
model using Sklearn library and 97% when built Neural Network model using Keras library.
